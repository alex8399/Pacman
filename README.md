# PacMan

### Stage: in progress

## Description of game

PacMan is a video game; the player controls the character through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts who pursue PacMan. When PacMan eats all of the dots, the player wins.

## Status
I am currently working on this project. Engine and map are mostly completed. The ghosts, PacMan and graphics are in progress. Everything is drawn by geometrical primitives now.
